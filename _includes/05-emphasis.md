I work in **biotech/biopharmaceutical** industry and I get to work in a __protein chemistry__ lab. Recently I've been working a lot on learning _**Python**_ and building scripts to run in _**PyMol**_ a "_molecular visualization system_", which is a really useful tool for understanding the structure of proteins.
